<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Dialysis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable dialysis devices market encompasses two primary types: peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). PD involves the infusion of a dialysis solution into the abdominal cavity, allowing waste removal through the peritoneum, facilitating home treatment and flexibility. In contrast, HD uses an external machine to filter blood through a dialyzer, typically requiring a clinic visit but increasingly incorporating portable options for improved patient mobility. Both types aim to enhance patient independence in managing kidney disease.</p></p>
