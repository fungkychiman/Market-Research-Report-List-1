<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Paint Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Electrostatic Paint Guns</li><li>Airless Electrostatic Paint Guns</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrostatic paint guns market is divided into two main types: pneumatic and airless electrostatic paint guns. Pneumatic electrostatic paint guns use compressed air to atomize and spray paint, providing a finer mist and even coat, making them ideal for detailed work and intricate surfaces. In contrast, airless electrostatic paint guns operate by using high pressure to pump paint directly, eliminating the need for compressed air. This results in faster application and reduced overspray, making them suitable for larger surfaces and industrial applications.</p></p>
